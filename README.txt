How to customize:
1. Open index.html in a code editor.
2. Replace all instances of YOUR_AFFILIATE_LINK with your actual affiliate URLs.
3. Replace placeholder images in /assets with your product images (same filenames) or update src in index.html.
4. Update brand text 'FashionGhar Picks' if you want a different name.

Deploy (Netlify — fastest):
1. Create a free account at https://app.netlify.com/
2. Drag-and-drop the site folder (the extracted files) into the Netlify dashboard > Sites area.
3. Netlify will publish a live URL instantly. Use that as your link-in-bio.

Alternate deploy (Vercel):
1. Create a free account at https://vercel.com/
2. New Project → Import From Git → link a GitHub repo containing these files → Deploy.
3. Set Environment variables if needed (not necessary for this static site).
